`correlation` is an [**easystats**](https://github.com/easystats/easystats) package focused on correlation analysis. It's lightweight, easy to use, and allows for the computation of many different kinds of correlations, such as **partial** correlations, **Bayesian** correlations, **multilevel** correlations, **polychoric** correlations, **biweight**, **percentage bend** or **Sheperd's Pi** correlations (types of robust correlation), **distance** correlation (a type of non-linear correlation) and more, also allowing for combinations between them (for instance, *Bayesian partial multilevel correlation*).

# Features

The *correlation* package can compute many different types of correlation,
including:

✅ **Pearson's correlation**<br>
✅ **Spearman's rank correlation**<br>
✅ **Kendall's rank correlation**<br>
✅ **Biweight midcorrelation**<br>
✅ **Distance correlation**<br>
✅ **Percentage bend correlation**<br>
✅ **Shepherd's Pi correlation**<br>
✅ **Blomqvist’s coefficient**<br>
✅ **Hoeffding’s D**<br>
✅ **Gamma correlation**<br>
✅ **Gaussian rank correlation**<br>
✅ **Point-Biserial and biserial correlation**<br>
✅ **Winsorized correlation**<br>
✅ **Polychoric correlation**<br>
✅ **Tetrachoric correlation**<br>
✅ **Multilevel correlation**<br>

An overview and description of these correlations types is [**available here**](https://easystats.github.io/correlation/articles/types.html). Moreover,
many of these correlation types are available as **partial** or within a
**Bayesian** framework.

# Examples

The main function is [`correlation()`](https://easystats.github.io/correlation/reference/correlation.html), which builds on top of [`cor_test()`](https://easystats.github.io/correlation/reference/cor_test.html) and comes with a number of possible options.

## Correlation details and matrix

```{r README-4}
results <- correlation(iris)
results
```

The output is not a square matrix, but a **(tidy) dataframe with all correlations tests per row**. One can also obtain a **matrix** using:

```{r README-5}
summary(results)
```

Note that one can also obtain the full, **square** and redundant matrix using:

```{r README-6}
summary(results, redundant = TRUE)
```


```{r README-7}
library(see)

results %>%
  summary(redundant = TRUE) %>%
  plot()
```

## Correlation tests

The `cor_test()` function, for pairwise correlations, is also very convenient for making quick scatter plots.

```{r README-corr}
plot(cor_test(iris, "Sepal.Width", "Sepal.Length"))
```

## Grouped dataframes

The `correlation()` function also supports **stratified correlations**, all within the
*tidyverse* workflow!

```{r README-8}
iris %>%
  select(Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Width) %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  correlation()
```


## Bayesian Correlations

It is very easy to switch to a **Bayesian framework**.

```{r README-9}
correlation(iris, bayesian = TRUE)
```

## Tetrachoric, Polychoric, Biserial, Biweight...

The `correlation` package also supports different types of methods, which can
deal with correlations **between factors**!

```{r README-10}
correlation(iris, include_factors = TRUE, method = "auto")
```


## Partial Correlations

It also supports **partial correlations** (as well as Bayesian partial correlations).

```{r README-11}
iris %>%
  correlation(partial = TRUE) %>%
  summary()
```

## Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs)

Such partial correlations can also be represented as **Gaussian Graphical
Models** (GGM), an increasingly popular tool in psychology. A GGM traditionally
include a set of variables depicted as circles ("nodes"), and a set of lines
that visualize relationships between them, which thickness represents the
strength of association (see [Bhushan et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01050/full)).

```{r README-12}
library(see) # for plotting
library(ggraph) # needs to be loaded

mtcars %>%
  correlation(partial = TRUE) %>%
  plot()
```

## Multilevel Correlations

It also provide some cutting-edge methods, such as Multilevel (partial)
correlations. These are are partial correlations based on linear mixed-effects
models that include the factors as **random effects**. They can be see as
correlations *adjusted* for some group (*hierarchical*) variability.

```{r README-13}
iris %>%
  correlation(partial = TRUE, multilevel = TRUE) %>%
  summary()
```

However, if the `partial` argument is set to `FALSE`, it will try to convert the
partial coefficient into regular ones.These can be **converted back** to full
correlations:

```{r README-14}
iris %>%
  correlation(partial = FALSE, multilevel = TRUE) %>%
  summary()
```
