\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{x, y}{Names of two variables present in the data.}

\item{method}{A character string indicating which correlation coefficient is
to be used for the test. One of \code{"pearson"} (default),
\code{"kendall"}, \code{"spearman"} (but see also the \code{robust} argument), \code{"biserial"},
\code{"polychoric"}, \code{"tetrachoric"}, \code{"biweight"},
\code{"distance"}, \code{"percentage"} (for percentage bend correlation),
\code{"blomqvist"} (for Blomqvist's coefficient), \code{"hoeffding"} (for
Hoeffding's D), \code{"gamma"}, \code{"gaussian"} (for Gaussian Rank
correlation) or \code{"shepherd"} (for Shepherd's Pi correlation). Setting
\code{"auto"} will attempt at selecting the most relevant method
(polychoric when ordinal factors involved, tetrachoric when dichotomous
factors involved, point-biserial if one dichotomous and one continuous and
pearson otherwise). See below the \strong{details} section for a desription of
these indices.}

\item{ci}{Confidence/Credible Interval level. If \code{"default"}, then it is
set to \code{0.95} (\verb{95\%} CI).}

\item{bayesian, partial_bayesian}{If TRUE, will run the correlations under a
Bayesian framework. Note that for partial correlations, you will also need
to set \code{partial_bayesian} to \code{TRUE} to obtain "full" Bayesian
partial correlations. Otherwise, you will obtain pseudo-Bayesian partial
correlations (i.e., Bayesian correlation based on frequentist
partialization).}

\item{bayesian_prior}{For the prior argument, several named values are
recognized: \code{"medium.narrow"}, \code{"medium"}, \code{"wide"}, and
\code{"ultrawide"}. These correspond to scale values of \code{1/sqrt(27)},
\code{1/3}, \code{1/sqrt(3)} and \code{1}, respectively. See the
\code{BayesFactor::correlationBF} function.}

\item{bayesian_ci_method, bayesian_test}{See arguments in
\code{\link[=parameters]{model_parameters()}} for \code{BayesFactor} tests.}

\item{include_factors}{If \code{TRUE}, the factors are kept and eventually
converted to numeric or used as random effects (depending of
\code{multilevel}). If \code{FALSE}, factors are removed upfront.}

\item{partial}{Can be \code{TRUE} or \code{"semi"} for partial and
semi-partial correlations, respectively.}

\item{multilevel}{If \code{TRUE}, the factors are included as random factors.
Else, if \code{FALSE} (default), they are included as fixed effects in the
simple regression model.}

\item{ranktransform}{If \code{TRUE}, will rank-transform the variables prior to
estimating the correlation, which is one way of making the analysis more
resistant to extreme values (outliers). Note that, for instance, a Pearson's
correlation on rank-transformed data is equivalent to a Spearman's rank
correlation. Thus, using \code{robust=TRUE} and \code{method="spearman"} is
redundant. Nonetheless, it is an easy option to increase the robustness of the
correlation as well as flexible way to obtain Bayesian or multilevel
Spearman-like rank correlations.}

\item{robust}{Old name for \code{ranktransform}. Will be removed in subsequent
versions, so better to use \code{ranktransform} which is more explicit about
what it does.}

\item{winsorize}{Another way of making the correlation more "robust" (i.e.,
limiting the impact of extreme values). Can be either \code{FALSE} or a
number between 0 and 1 (e.g., \code{0.2}) that corresponds to the desired
threshold. See the \code{\link[=winsorize]{winsorize()}} function for more details.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (e.g., \code{alternative}) to be passed to
other methods. See \code{stats::cor.test} for further details.}

\details{
\subsection{Correlation Types}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Pearson's correlation}: This is the most common correlation
method. It corresponds to the covariance of the two variables normalized
(i.e., divided) by the product of their standard deviations.

\item \strong{Spearman's rank correlation}: A non-parametric measure of rank
correlation (statistical dependence between the rankings of two variables).
The Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the Pearson
correlation between the rank values of those two variables; while Pearson's
correlation assesses linear relationships, Spearman's correlation assesses
monotonic relationships (whether linear or not). Confidence Intervals (CI)
for Spearman's correlations are computed using the Fieller et al. (1957)
correction (see Bishara and Hittner, 2017).

\item \strong{Kendall's rank correlation}: In the normal case, the Kendall
correlation is preferred than the Spearman correlation because of a smaller
gross error sensitivity (GES) and a smaller asymptotic variance (AV), making
it more robust and more efficient. However, the interpretation of Kendall's
tau is less direct than that of Spearman's rho, in the sense that it
quantifies the difference between the percentage of concordant and discordant pairs
among all possible pairwise events. Confidence Intervals (CI) for Kendall's
correlations are computed using the Fieller et al. (1957) correction (see
Bishara and Hittner, 2017).

\item \strong{Biweight midcorrelation}: A measure of similarity that is
median-based, instead of the traditional mean-based, thus being less
sensitive to outliers. It can be used as a robust alternative to other
similarity metrics, such as Pearson correlation (Langfelder & Horvath,
2012).

\item \strong{Distance correlation}: Distance correlation measures both
linear and non-linear association between two random variables or random
vectors. This is in contrast to Pearson's correlation, which can only detect
linear association between two random variables.

\item \strong{Percentage bend correlation}: Introduced by Wilcox (1994), it
is based on a down-weight of a specified percentage of marginal observations
deviating from the median (by default, \verb{20\%}).

\item \strong{Shepherd's Pi correlation}: Equivalent to a Spearman's rank
correlation after outliers removal (by means of bootstrapped Mahalanobis
distance).

\item \strong{Blomqvist’s coefficient}: The Blomqvist’s coefficient (also
referred to as Blomqvist's Beta or medial correlation; Blomqvist, 1950) is a
median-based non-parametric correlation that has some advantages over
measures such as Spearman's or Kendall's estimates (see Shmid & Schimdt,
2006).

\item \strong{Hoeffding’s D}: The Hoeffding’s D statistics is a
non-parametric rank based measure of association that detects more general
departures from independence (Hoeffding 1948), including non-linear
associations. Hoeffding’s D varies between -0.5 and 1 (if there are no tied
ranks, otherwise it can have lower values), with larger values indicating a
stronger relationship between the variables.

\item \strong{Somers’ D}: The Somers’ D statistics is a non-parametric rank
based measure of association between a binary variable and a continuous
variable, for instance, in the context of logistic regression the binary
outcome and the predicted probabilities for each outcome. Usually, Somers' D
is a measure of ordinal association, however, this implementation it is
limited to the case of a binary outcome.

\item \strong{Point-Biserial and biserial correlation}: Correlation
coefficient used when one variable is continuous and the other is dichotomous
(binary). Point-Biserial is equivalent to a Pearson's correlation, while
Biserial should be used when the binary variable is assumed to have an
underlying continuity. For example, anxiety level can be measured on a
continuous scale, but can be classified dichotomously as high/low.

\item \strong{Gamma correlation}: The Goodman-Kruskal gamma statistic is
similar to Kendall's Tau coefficient. It is relatively robust to outliers and
deals well with data that have many ties.

\item \strong{Winsorized correlation}: Correlation of variables that have
been formerly Winsorized, i.e., transformed by limiting extreme values to
reduce the effect of possibly spurious outliers.

\item \strong{Gaussian rank Correlation}: The Gaussian rank correlation
estimator is a simple and well-performing alternative for robust rank
correlations (Boudt et al., 2012). It is based on the Gaussian quantiles of
the ranks.

\item \strong{Polychoric correlation}: Correlation between two theorized
normally distributed continuous latent variables, from two observed ordinal
variables.

\item \strong{Tetrachoric correlation}: Special case of the polychoric
correlation applicable when both observed variables are dichotomous.
}}

\subsection{Partial Correlation}{
\strong{Partial correlations} are estimated as the correlation between two
variables after adjusting for the (linear) effect of one or more other
variable. The correlation test is then run after having partialized the
dataset, independently from it. In other words, it considers partialization
as an independent step generating a different dataset, rather than belonging
to the same model. This is why some discrepancies are to be expected for the
t- and p-values, CIs, BFs etc (but \emph{not} the correlation coefficient)
compared to other implementations (e.g., \code{ppcor}). (The size of these
discrepancies depends on the number of covariates partialled-out and the
strength of the linear association between all variables.) Such partial
correlations can be represented as Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM), an
increasingly popular tool in psychology. A GGM traditionally include a set of
variables depicted as circles ("nodes"), and a set of lines that visualize
relationships between them, which thickness represents the strength of
association (see Bhushan et al., 2019).
\cr\cr
\strong{Multilevel correlations} are a special case of partial correlations
where the variable to be adjusted for is a factor and is included as a random
effect in a mixed model (note that the remaining continuous variables of the
dataset will still be included as fixed effects, similarly to regular partial
correlations). That said, there is an important difference between using
\code{cor_test()} and \code{correlation()}: If you set \code{multilevel=TRUE}
in \code{correlation()} but \code{partial} is set to \code{FALSE} (as per
default), then a back-transformation from partial to non-partial correlation
will be attempted (through \code{\link[=pcor_to_cor]{pcor_to_cor()}}). However,
this is not possible when using \code{cor_test()} so that if you set
\code{multilevel=TRUE} in it, the resulting correlations are partial one.
Note that for Bayesian multilevel correlations, if \code{partial = FALSE},
the back transformation will also recompute p-values based on the new r scores,
and will drop the Bayes factors (as they are not relevant anymore). To keep
Bayesian scores, don't forget to set \code{partial = TRUE}.
}

\subsection{Notes}{
\itemize{
\item Kendall and Spearman correlations when \code{bayesian=TRUE}: These
are technically Pearson Bayesian correlations of rank transformed data,
rather than pure Bayesian rank correlations (which have different priors).
